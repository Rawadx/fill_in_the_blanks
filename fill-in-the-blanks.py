# IPND Stage 2 Final Project

# The Quizes

easy_quiz = '''A ___1___ is created with the def keyword. You specify the inputs a ___1___ takes by
adding ___2___ separated by commas between the parentheses. ___1___s by default return ___3___ if you
don't specify the value to return. ___2___ can be standard data types such as string, number, dictionary,
tuple, and ___4___ or can be more complicated such as objects and lambda functions.'''


medium_quiz = '''Python is an interpreted, ___1___, high-level programming language with dynamic ___2___.
Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive
for ___3___ Development, as well as for use as a __4___ or glue language to connect existing components
together.'''

hard_quiz = '''Python was created in the early 1990s by ___1___ at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum
in the ___2___ as a successor of a language called ___3___. Guido remains Pythonâ€™s principal author,
although it includes many contributions from others. All Python releases are ___4___. Historically, most,
but not all, Python releases have also been ___5___ compatible.'''

# Hint: It might help to think about how this project relates to the Mad Libs generator you built with Sean.
# In the Mad Libs generator, you take a paragraph and replace all instances of NOUN and VERB.
# How can you adapt that design to work with numbered blanks?
